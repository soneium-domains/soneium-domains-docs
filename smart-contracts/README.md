# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts for **Soneium Domains** are fully verified on **Soneium Explorer** and open source, available on the **Soneium Explorer** for transparency and ease of access. The deployed smart contract addresses can always be found on [the **Deployments** page](deployments.md).



Soneium Domains Smart Contracts closely mirror the **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** structure, allowing developers to interact with them using familiar methods. While we are preparing comprehensive developer documentation, you can use the existing ENS documentation to start building with Soneium Domains immediately.
