  Welcome to the developer documentation for Soneium Domains. This guide will
  help you integrate Soneium Domains into your applications, interact with the
  domain naming system.

# Overview

**Soneium Domains** is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system built on the Soneium Blockchain and is fully **ENS-based**.

Soneium Domains map human-readable names like 'jack.son' to machine-readable identifiers such as Soneium addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more. It also supports reverse resolution, making it possible to associate metadata such as primary names or interface descriptions with Soneium addresses.

Developers can currently use our JavaScript library **@soneium-domains/js** to integrate Soneium Domains into their applications.&#x20;

While we are preparing comprehensive developer documentation for Soneium Domains, you can utilize the existing [**ENS** (Ethereum Name Service)](https://docs.ens.domains) documentation to interact with our service, as our smart contract functions closely mirror the ENS structure. This means you can start building with Soneium Domains immediately, leveraging your familiarity with ENS while awaiting our full-fledged documentation.
